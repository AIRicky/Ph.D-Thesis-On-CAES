## English Abstract

Energy storage technology is one of the primary approaches to boost the operational flexibility of power systems with high-penetration renewables, and storage facilities are being gradually utilized at both the source, network, and load side of power systems. Advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) is one of the most attractive physical energy storage fashion because of its superior flexibilities, including conventional flexibility with energy-shift and power reserve capability, production flexibility regarding multi-carrier storage and poly-generation capability, and interface flexibility with mechanical input and output structure. This paper aims to exploit such kinds of flexibility offered by AA-CAES and provides associated design, modeling, and operation methods for the applications of storage plant, energy hub, and dispatch-able wind turbine at the network, load, and source side, respectively.

To explore the effects of external off-design operation requirements on the part-load behavior of internal components, such as energy conversion module (compressor and turbine), and energy transfer module (heat exchanger), and on the thermodynamic performance of energy storage module (air storage chamber and thermal storage tank), we built a steady-state thermodynamic simulation model for general-purpose realizations of AA-CAES. By exploiting possible pressure control methods, such as the normal and sliding operation for the compressor and expansion train, we built the first law and the second law of thermodynamics-based simulation model. Besides, we investigated the part-load operation performance of a typical AA-CAES system with the built thermodynamic model, which will provide the insights for the modeling of corresponding AA-CAES realizations at the source, network, and load side.

To exploit the conventional energy-shift and power reserve capability, we considered the regular application of AA-CAES as an energy storage fashion in power grids and proposed the modeling and operation methods with the consideration of its part-load operation. Based on the proposed thermodynamic simulation model, we proposed a cluster of thermodynamic feature curves to depict the unique characteristics represented by the coupling and decoupling of air compression heat and air potential energy in the charging and discharging cycle. Moreover, with the thermodynamic feature curves, we proposed the dual-SOC modeling framework and associated models for AA-CAES storage facility by considering the air mass SOC and thermal energy SOC. Last, we justified the effectiveness of dual-SOC models through the operation dispatch of the wind-CAES hybrid system, and the optimal bidding strategy of AA-CAES in the electricity market, to set a reference for the application of the proposed dual-SOC modeling framework.

To exploit the multi-carrier storage and poly-generation flexibility, we investigated the energy hub application of AA-CAES as a flexible load form in the integrated heat-power systems. We constructed two typical forms of AA-CAES based flexible energy hubs and provided the operation model of multi-carrier production. Moreover, we proposed the optimal dispatch model for integrated heat and power energy systems coupled with AA-CAES based energy hub in the coordinated operation setting and formulated a combined quantity and quality operation model to leverage the multi-carrier quality perspective through the exergy method. Besides, we proposed an optimal strategic bidding method to investigate the market participation behavior of a privately-owned AA-CAES energy hub in an envisioned heat and power market to exploit its multi-carrier production flexibility.

To exploit the mechanical interface flexibility, we proposed a novel dispatchable wind turbine with embedded AA-CAES to reduce the uncertainty imposed by the volatile wind energy and proposed associate modeling, dispatch and operation methods. We utilized the air compression cycle to collect the curtailed wind mechanical energy when wind speed is higher than the rated speed and the air expansion cycle to re-fill the shortage of mechanical wind energy once wind speed is lower than the rated one. Moreover, we offered several methods to boost the operation efficiency of AA-CAES with fluctuate wind mechanical energy input and output, and we built the energy and double-reserve model of the proposed wind turbine. Besides, based on energy model, we performed the electricity generation capability evaluation of the dispatchable wind turbine, and proposed the operation dispatch of power systems with high penetration of wind farms and the market operation strategy of the dispatchable wind turbine, to justify its capabilities in boosting wind dispatch-ability, and wind power and electricity penetration level.

In summary, this paper builds a thermodynamic simulation model for the general-purpose realization of AA-CAES to consider its off-design operation and internal part-load feature, and exploit the potential flexibilities offered by AA-CAES in terms of an energy storage, an energy hub, and a dispatchable wind turbine at the network, load, and source side, respectively. The proposed design, modeling, and operation methods are expected to benefit the exploitation and application of the conventional energy-shift and power reserve flexibility, the external multi-carrier generation flexibility, and the mechanical interface flexibility offered by the attractive concept of AA-CAES, in power systems. Our work has realized a combination of “after-the-fact remediation” and “precaution prevention” flexibility boosting solution, which utilized the energy storage plant (network side) and the energy hub (load side) to “passively” meet the existing flexible resource requirements of the power systems and the flexible wind turbine (source-side) “actively” provides flexibility with no increment of flexibility demand for its grid-connection, and finally benefits the renewable consumption of power systems.
